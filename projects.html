                    <p>Whilst there are no official roles at L Stands for Winner like lead designer or lead developer, I was still involved in many aspects of the project, with some areas having greater involvement than others.</p> 
                    <p>I was responsible for designing and developing the movement system for the character, which involved brainstorming with teammates, writing design documentation, developing the movement code and conducting playtests for each part of the movement.</p> 
                    <p>I was also responsible for crafting many of the levels, which required brainstorming and creating design documentation for level design philosophies, thematics, difficulty, as well as creating the levels themselves and adjusting them based on playtester feedback that I recieved.</p>

                                </div>
                                <p>One of our key design principles for Phoenix One was for the movement to feel fast, fluid and crisp to ensure that the pace of the game was quick and to encourage speedrunning. </p>
                                <p>To create this, I made sure elements of the movement felt precise and responsive, such as the left-right movement having very little acceleration and decelleration times to allow for quick direction changes, and little-to-no end-lag being implemented on the character's moveset so multiple movement options could be chained together for a more fluid feel.</p>

                                </div>
                                <p>To ensure that the game felt both fast-paced and puzzling/challenging, I spent a great deal of time designing, revising and implementing levels to ensure that they had the correct feel.</p>
                                <p>When designing the levels, rather than plan a whole layout first, I designed them encounter by encounter, resulting in a variety of different challenges for the player in one level, whilst also keeping to the same theme and difficulty. This helped to create a cohesive and engaging level, of whose elements gelled well together.</p>

                                <p>A large part of the narrative of Phoenix One lies in the narrative collectibles that lie around on each level, which include captain logs, research journals and miscellaneous findings.</p>
                                <p>In the collectible narrative pieces, I made sure to accentuate each character's personality, quirks and mannerisms and convey the relationship they had with other major characters or events in the plotline through their eyes, such as Dr Aspen being very inquisitive, committed, yet slightly more reserved and quiet when compared to the bold, confident leader that is the Captain. With the miscellaneous, I elected for the direction of making them world-building material to create a stronger image for the player of how life was like onboard the Phoenix One for the rest of the crew. </p>
