                                        <p>With the largest part of this project, the visuals, being done by other
                                            teammates, I
                                            was assigned the second-largest part, which was the audio and the soundscape
                                            that
                                            would be created to help the user get ready for sleep. </p>
                                        <p>The audio had to be created in a way that allowed the user to feel
                                            comfortable
                                            and
                                            relaxed, but also prevented them from focussing too much on the noise rather
                                            than
                                            trying to sleep, which meaning recording and mixing sounds that both had to
                                            be
                                            quiet
                                            and non-intrusive, such as ocean noises without the crashing of waves, fire
                                            sounds
                                            without the peaking and crackling of the fire, etc.</p>
                                        <p>Similarly to the rest of the sounds, the narration and chatting from the
                                            other
                                            "people" had to be at a very precise volume, as the narration and chatting
                                            had
                                            to be
                                            loud enough for the user to register that they were surrounded by other
                                            people,
                                            but
                                            quiet enough so that what was being said could not be determined and the
                                            user
                                            would
                                            focus on the speech rather than trying to feel sleepy.</p>
                                        <p>Given how this was a VR experience that was set on a remote beach, I felt
                                            that
                                            narration by others would enhance the experience even more by making the
                                            user
                                            feel
                                            "safe" in their imaginary environment, knowing that there were "people"
                                            situated
                                            around them.</p>
