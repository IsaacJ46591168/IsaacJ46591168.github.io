                                        <p>One of our key design principles for Phoenix One was for the movement to feel
                                            fast, fluid and crisp to ensure that the pace of the game was quick and to
                                            encourage speedrunning. </p>
                                        <p>To create this, I made sure elements of the movement felt precise and
                                            responsive,
                                            such as the left-right movement having very little acceleration and
                                            decelleration times to allow for quick direction changes, and little-to-no
                                            end-lag being implemented on the character's moveset so multiple movement
                                            options could be chained together for a more fluid feel.</p>

                                        <p>To ensure that the game felt both fast-paced and puzzling/challenging, I
                                            spent a
                                            great deal of time designing, revising and implementing levels to ensure
                                            that
                                            they had the correct feel.</p>
                                        <p>When designing the levels, rather than plan a whole layout first, I designed
                                            them
                                            encounter by encounter, resulting in a variety of different challenges for
                                            the
                                            player in one level, whilst also keeping to the same theme and difficulty.
                                            This
                                            helped to create a cohesive and engaging level, of whose elements gelled
                                            well
                                            together.</p>

                                        <p>A large part of the narrative of Phoenix One lies in the narrative
                                            collectibles
                                            that lie around on each level, which include captain logs, research journals
                                            and
                                            miscellaneous findings.</p>
                                        <p>In the collectible narrative pieces, I made sure to accentuate each
                                            character's
                                            personality, quirks and mannerisms and convey the relationship they had with
                                            other major characters or events in the plotline through their eyes, such as
                                            Dr
                                            Aspen being very inquisitive, committed, yet slightly more reserved and
                                            quiet
                                            when compared to the bold, confident leader that is the Captain. With the
                                            miscellaneous, I elected for the direction of making them world-building
                                            material to create a stronger image for the player of how life was like
                                            onboard
                                            the Phoenix One for the rest of the crew. </p>
